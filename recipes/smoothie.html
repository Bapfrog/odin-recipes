        <div id="pink" class="ingredients">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen cherries</li>
            <li>Frozen berry mix</li>
            <li>Whole fat vanilla yogurt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Chia seeds</li>
            <li>Baby spinach</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>We're going to use a Magic Bullet mini blender for this receipe, pouring all of the ingredients into the tall tumbler.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of frozen fruit, using equal parts cherries and berries (though you're encouraged to experiment with ratios to find the mix that you like best).</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 of a banana, 1/2 cup of milk, and 1/2 cup of yogurt.</li>
            <li>Top this off with a tablespoon of chia seeds and a handful of spinach, and screw on the lid.</li>
            <li>Mix for about 10 seconds, then check the consistency - if it seems too thick (like, you turn the tumbler upside-down and the contents don't move), add a bit more milk. Either way, give it a good shake and then mix for another 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>That's it! Pour it into a cup or drink it straight out of the tumbler. This recipe provides a wonder assortment of macronutrients . . . just beware of the dreaded brain freeze!</li>
        </ol>
