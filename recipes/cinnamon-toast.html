        <p>Cinnamon toast is a delicious snack that is quick and easy to make.</p>
        <p>The great thing about cinnamon toast is that the name of the dish effectively doubles as the recipe. If you can make toast, you can make cinnamon toast!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sandwich bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix equal parts cinnamon and sugar (1 tsp of each should suffice) into a small bowl. If you like, you can mix a larger amount and store in a dedicated shaker for convenient use in the future.</li>
            <li>Using a toaster or toaster oven, toast the bread to a golden brown.</li>
            <li>Quickly remove the bread from the toaster and generously apply butter; we want the heat of the toast to melt the butter.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon (or your shaker if you've prepared one), sprinkle the cinnamon-and-sugar-mixture all over the buttered surface of the toast. The topping should turn a dark brown as it absorbs into the butter.</li>
        </ol>
