        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Bullet proof coffee is a great way to upgrade your morning pick-me-up into your breakfast-in-a-cup.</p>
        <p>You're basically transforming your coffee into a meal by adding beneficial fat calories via butter and/or coconut oil. The result is a keto-friendly drink that can keep your hunger satiated until lunchtime!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Coconut oil</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>We're going to use a Magic Bullet mini blender for this receipe. Pour your usual amout of coffee into the short plastic tumbler.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>If you'd like, you can also add 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder to mocha-fy your beverage experience.</li>
            <li>Screw on the mixer lid and place the tumbler, lid-side down, into the Magic Bullet. Push firmly down on the tumbler to engage the mixing action. The mixer spins at several thousand RPMs, so it only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Unscrew the lid and pour this frothy concoction into your favorite mug. You should end up with nice layer of foam on top. Enjoy!</li>
